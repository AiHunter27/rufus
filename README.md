###Keyword-Driven Web Scraping with LLM-Powered Optimization
This project leverages the power of LLMs to improve keyword-based web scraping. Traditional keyword scraping approaches often struggle with precision when extracting relevant content based solely on user queries. To overcome this, we use an LLM to extract more accurate and contextually rich keywords from the user query. These enhanced keywords are then used to drive the web scraping process, resulting in a more dynamic and efficient system.

###How It Works
#LLM-Driven Keyword Extraction:
Instead of relying on static or user-generated keywords, the system dynamically generates a comprehensive and semantically relevant set of keywords using a large language model (LLM). This helps capture the intent behind user queries, improving the accuracy of keyword-driven scraping.

#Optimized Keyword-Based Scraping:
After extracting high-quality keywords, the scraping process focuses on these terms to gather only the most relevant data from web pages. This ensures that the process remains efficient while avoiding the overhead of scraping all page content, which would be required for a semantic search approach.

#Key Improvements
Enhanced Keyword Generation:
By utilizing LLMs to produce both partial and full keyword matches, the scraping system becomes more robust and flexible, covering a wider range of relevant terms.

#Robust and Dynamic Scraping:
The process dynamically adapts based on the keywords extracted, avoiding the inefficiency of scraping unnecessary data. This makes the scraping both more efficient and context-aware, balancing between precision and resource usage.
